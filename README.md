The Complexity of program 1 is O(n): because here we are creating a Byte content and all the methods are called once so its complexity will be O(n) 
The Complexity of program 2 is O(n): Because here  we are listing .js files from a directory and all the methods are called once so its complexity will be O(n) 
The Complexity of program 3 is O(n): Because here  we are creating a Temp file and all the methods are called once so its complexity will be O(n) 
The Complexity of program 4 is O(n):Because here  we are creating a property file and all the methods are called once so its complexity will be O(n) 
The Complexity of program 5 is O(n):Because here  we are creating an xml file and all the methods are called once so its complexity will be O(n)
